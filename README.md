Nestion Display with ESPhome

This my version of the nextion display controlling my Home assistant setup over touchscreen
I have 3 of these in my home and work perfect for me ;)

The nextion is connected to a Wemos D1 Mini

In the Pictures folder you find the photoshop files and also the jpg files.

You can see an example here on youtube.
